## üîê SSH and Remote Connections

SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol that allows secure remote access to Linux systems. It's an essential tool for system administrators and DevOps engineers.

### SSH Components

**Required Packages:**
- `openssh-client` - For connecting to remote servers
- `openssh-server` - For accepting incoming SSH connections

### Popular SSH Clients

| Client | Platform | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **OpenSSH** | Linux/macOS/Windows | Built-in terminal client |
| **PuTTY** | Windows | Lightweight GUI client |
| **Termius** | Cross-platform | Modern GUI with sync features |
| **MobaXterm** | Windows | Advanced terminal with X11 |

### Basic SSH Usage

```bash
# Find your machine's IP address
ip -br a

# Connect to a remote server
ssh <IP_ADDRESS>
ssh <USERNAME>@<IP_ADDRESS>

# Example
ssh john@192.168.1.100
```

> üí° **Pro Tip:** On Windows systems, if you don't specify a username, SSH will use your current Windows username as the default.

### SSH Connection Process

1. **Host Key Verification**: First connection prompts for public key confirmation
2. **Authentication**: Enter password or use SSH keys
3. **Session Establishment**: Secure encrypted connection established

## üìÅ Linux File Hierarchy Standard (FHS)

The FHS defines the directory structure and directory contents in Linux distributions. Understanding this hierarchy is crucial for effective system navigation and administration.

```
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bin/          # Essential user binaries
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ boot/         # Boot loader files, kernel
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ etc/          # System configuration files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ home/         # User home directories
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ root/         # Root user's home directory
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tmp/          # Temporary files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ var/          # Variable data (logs, caches)
```

### Key Directories Explained

| Directory | Purpose | Examples |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **`/`** | Root directory - top of hierarchy | Everything stems from here |
| **`/home`** | User personal files and settings | `/home/john`, `/home/jane` |
| **`/bin`** | Essential executable programs | `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `cat` |
| **`/var`** | Variable data (logs, caches, mail) | `/var/log/syslog`, `/var/cache` |
| **`/etc`** | System-wide configuration files | `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/hosts` |
| **`/tmp`** | Temporary files | Session files, temp downloads |
| **`/boot`** | Boot process files | Kernel, bootloader config |
| **`/root`** | Root user's home directory | Superuser's personal space |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** The root user (`/root`) has the highest permissions with full system access. Handle with extreme care!

> üìù **Note:** Ubuntu removes `/tmp` contents after each reboot, but policies vary across distributions.

### The "Everything is a File" Philosophy

In Linux, **everything is treated as a file** - including:
- Regular files and directories
- Hardware devices (`/dev/sda1`, `/dev/tty`)
- Process information (`/proc/cpuinfo`)
- System information (`/sys/class/net`)

## üß≠ Essential Navigation Commands

Master these fundamental commands to efficiently navigate the Linux filesystem.

### Core Navigation Commands

#### `pwd` - Print Working Directory
Shows your current location in the filesystem.

```bash
pwd
# Output: /home/username/Documents
```

#### `ls` - List Directory Contents
The most versatile command for viewing files and directories.

```bash
# Basic listing
ls

# Show hidden files (starting with .)
ls -a

# Detailed listing with permissions, ownership, size, date
ls -l

# Human-readable file sizes
ls -l -h

# Combine options
ls -a -l -h
```

#### `cd` - Change Directory
Navigate between directories efficiently.

```bash
# Go to specific directory
cd /var/log

# Go to home directory
cd ~
# or simply
cd

# Go to parent directory
cd ..

# Go to previous directory
cd -

# Navigate relative to current location
cd Documents/Projects
```

### Special Directory Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **`~`** | Current user's home directory | `cd ~` ‚Üí `/home/username` |
| **`.`** | Current directory | `ls .` |
| **`..`** | Parent directory | `cd ..` |
| **`-`** | Previous directory | `cd -` |

> ‚å®Ô∏è **Keyboard Shortcut:** Use `Ctrl + C` to cancel any command that's currently typing or running.

> üéØ **Auto-completion Tip:** Type the first few letters of a file/directory name and press `Tab` for automatic completion!

## üìÑ File Operations

### Copying Files and Directories

The `cp` command copies files and directories with various options for different scenarios.

```bash
# Copy file to new location
cp source.txt destination.txt

# Copy file to directory (keeps original name)
cp file.txt /path/to/directory/

# Copy directory recursively
cp -r source_directory/ destination_directory/

# Interactive mode (asks before overwriting)
cp -i file.txt backup.txt

# Verbose mode (shows what's being copied)
cp -v *.txt /backup/
```

### Moving and Renaming Files

The `mv` command both moves and renames files - there's no separate rename command in Linux.

```bash
# Move file to new location
mv oldfile.txt /new/path/

# Rename a file
mv oldname.txt newname.txt

# Move and rename simultaneously
mv /old/path/file.txt /new/path/newname.txt

# Interactive mode (asks before overwriting)
mv -i important.txt backup/
```

### Removing Files and Directories

The `rm` command permanently deletes files and directories.

```bash
# Remove single file
rm filename.txt

# Remove multiple files
rm file1.txt file2.txt

# Remove directory and contents recursively
rm -r directory_name/

# Interactive mode (asks for confirmation)
rm -i important.txt

# Force removal (no confirmation)
rm -f stubborn_file.txt

# Verbose mode (shows what's being deleted)
rm -v old_files.txt
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** `rm -f` and `rm -i` are opposites! Use `-i` for safety, `-f` for force.

### Viewing File Contents

The `cat` command displays file contents in the terminal.

```bash
# Display file contents
cat filename.txt

# Show line numbers
cat -n script.py

# Show line numbers (skip empty lines)
cat -b document.txt

# Display multiple files
cat file1.txt file2.txt
```
