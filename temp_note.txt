- Network:

IP address -> layer 3
unique address assigned to each node
IPv4, IPv6

Port -> layar 4 and above
distinguishes different services on the same host
16 bit -> 65535

IP:Port -> a specific socket


Protocols:
- TCP	: a reliable connection at layar 4
- UDP	: a connectionless protocol at layer 4
- ICMP	: a troubleshooting protocol at layer 3


OSI		-> 7 layer
TCP/IP	-> 4 layer


IPv4	: in 4 octets(32 bit)
we solve problem lack of IPv4s with public/private IPs
localhost -> 127.0.0.1

IPv4 classes -> A to E


ip command

ip link -> shows interfaces installed on the system
@ it will also work with something like "ip lin" or "ip l"

# ip link set dev <interface_name> <UP/DOWN>
# ip link set dev <interface_name> address <custom_MAC_address>


ip address -> shows information about interfaces

# ip address add 192.168.10.10/24 dev <interface_name>
# ip a del 192.168.10.10/24 dev <interface_name>


ip route -> to manage the routing of layer 3 communications

# ip route show(the default command)
# ip route add/del <routing_settings>
	ip route del default via 192.168.206.2
	

@ changes on MAC and IP address or routing rules are not persistent.
@ in every distrobution we have a different method to make changes permanent

ubuntu server 18>=	-> netplan

we set the configurations in a(any) .yaml file inside the /etc/netplan

# netplan try	: to temporary set the new config on the machine
# netplan apply	: to set the new config
	@ it is good practice to use --debug with apply


ping	: use ICMP to see if the destination is reachable
	-s	: to determine the size of each packet 
	-c	: to determine number of packets(endless is default)


ss	: to see open ports on the machine
	-t	: TCP sockets
	-u	: UDP sockets
	-l	: listening sockets
	-n/ -r	: show numberic/service_name ports
	-p	: show procceses running on each port
